# autoPruneCartTree
A function for R that can generate and prune a cart Tree automatically. Can be useful if many tests must be performed in a loop.

## @from        = formula
## @dat         = data
## @maxAttempts = integer, number of max attempts 
## @attempts    = integer, a counter that overrides recursive solution to prevent infinite loops
## @return      = a pruned tree (recursive approach)
